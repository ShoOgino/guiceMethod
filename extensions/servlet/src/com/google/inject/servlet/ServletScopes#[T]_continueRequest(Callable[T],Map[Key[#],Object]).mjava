  /**
   * Wraps the given callable in a contextual callable that "continues" the

   * threads.
   * <p>
   * There are some limitations:
   * <ul>
   *   <li>Derived objects (i.e. anything marked @RequestScoped will not be
   *      transported.</li>
   *   <li>State changes to the HttpServletRequest after this method is called
   *      will not be seen in the continued thread.</li>
   *   <li>Only the HttpServletRequest, ServletContext and request parameter
   *      map are available in the continued thread. The response and session
   *      are not available.</li>
   * </ul>
   *
   * @param callable code to be executed in another thread, which depends on
   *     the request scope.
   * @return a callable that will invoke the given callable, making the request
   *     context available to it.
   * @throws OutOfScopeException if this method is called from a non-request
   *     thread, or if the request has completed.
